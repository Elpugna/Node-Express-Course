# Task Manager (BackEnd APP)

- This proyect uses Mongo DB Atlas, soy you may first want to [register here](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login).

### Once you've done that, after downloading this repo, and installed the dependencies with:
> npm install
### you must create a cluster in your Mongo DB Atlas account, and then create a ".env" file in the root folder with the following text:
>MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://`<user>`:`<password>`@`<yourClusterInfo>`.mongodb.net/`<databaseName>`?retryWrites=true&w=majority

You can watch [this](https://youtu.be/jIsj0upCBAM?t=2510) if you have any trouble with the Mongo DB Atlas, or [this](https://youtu.be/jIsj0upCBAM?t=4096) if you have any trouble with the .env file
